### Overview ========
![Bacteria by filterforge.com](Images/bacteria.jpg)

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.




### Configuration Instructions ========
* I installed LiveServer in VSCode in order to render the index.html page correctly and pull the samples.json data through the browser at URL: http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html. Index.html file will not display samples.json correctly if running from c:\ directory.

* Version of LiveServer = RitwickDey


### Installation Instructions ==========
Applications used:

- Javascript / Plotly
- Google Chrome browser
- Visual Studio Code
- GitBash terminal
- Git Hub (to save versions and share code while in development)
- Image viewer such as Microsoft Photos or Microsoft Paint
* Similar applications may also work.
